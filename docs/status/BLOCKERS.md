# Blockers for humans (aggregate)

Integration copies open blockers from the four lane files here at each merge, newest first, so humans have one place to look. Answer by editing the relevant doc or `.env`, then tick the line in the lane file.


## Shift note (integration, 2026-10-24 ~16:40 PT)
- Answered by a human: keys and phone numbers in ~/lw-voice/.env, Convex project healthy-chipmunk-255; R-03 sex-evidence wording approved (D-40); script truth calls (D-41). Voice was started at 4:05 PM (never stalled).
- Still open: R-06 reasoner wording, the Card A recording, W-11 look approval, card print; Twilio webhook + ngrok after V-01 lands.
- Watch: Voice's gateway tasks (X-01b, V-01, V-03…V-07, V-11), the critical path.

## Open (newest first)

- [ ] humans · S-04 · After Voice lands V-01: start `ngrok http 8787 --domain $NGROK_DOMAIN` on the gateway Mac and set the Twilio number's voice webhook to `{PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/twilio/voice`.

- [ ] voice · V-02 · Record a ~20 s 16 kHz mono WAV of someone reading Card A's caller lines → `apps/eval/audio/A01.wav` (gitignored; `ffmpeg -i in.m4a -ar 16000 -ac 1 -sample_fmt s16 A01.wav`) for the live Ink 2 spike; also needs the Cartesia key.
- [ ] reasoning · R-06 · Reasoner prompt: on B01 it asks for an exact LKW clock time or a speech check instead of the face/arm check. Proposed docs/04 §3 wording (`reasoner-2`) in docs/status/reasoning.md. → approve/reject by editing docs/04.
- [ ] screens · W-11 · Presenter: approve the console/board look from 2 m (screenshots in apps/web/screenshots/).
- [x] reasoning · R-03 · **Approved (D-40)**: sex evidence is quoted as a phrase with context, never a bare pronoun; reasoning lands docs/04 §2 + the prompt together. ~~The fast-pass prompt makes the model quote "he" as sex evidence, which the validator drops (< 3 chars). Proposed docs/04 wording change (bump to `fast-2`) is in docs/status/reasoning.md. → approve or reject by editing docs/04 §2.~~

- [ ] integration · C-04 · Print `docs/cards/cards.html` duplex (flip on long edge), seal each back; marker for the LKW blanks (D-20); slide + two timed pitch dry runs. Regenerate with `pnpm cards` if a script changes.

- [x] integration · C-02 · Answered (D-41): B08 → likely; look-alike likely = false positive; A05 aspirin named, never "blood thinner". ~~Clinical glance at the 20 eval scripts (`apps/eval/scripts/*.json`): truth choices B08 (`possible` although face + speech), C02/C03 (signs counted on look-alikes), A05 (aspirin as the blood thinner). Non-blocking; scripts are landed. → edit the JSON or tick in docs/status/integration.md.~~
- [x] all · keys · Done: ~/lw-voice/.env has the Anthropic, Cartesia and Twilio keys, the three phone numbers and CONVEX_URL; LASTWELL_FAKES empty on the gateway Mac. Remaining human step: Twilio webhook + ngrok after V-01 lands. ~~Anthropic, Cartesia and Twilio keys plus `DISPATCHER_PHONE`, `ALERT_DEFAULT_TARGET_PHONE`, `ALERT_ALLOWED_NUMBERS` (docs/10 §9). Every lane builds against fakes meanwhile; live criteria are `blocked-keys`.~~
